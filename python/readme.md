## Python Notebook

* Install Python extension
* Open `hello.py`. Python notebook related commands should be rendered as codelens
  * Click **Run Cell**
  * For first time users, it will install Notebook related dependencies for you, which might take a few minutes
  * Once all the dependencies installed, you can
* Open `hello.ipynb`. A jupyter notebook will be opened in a webview
  * Every cell in the editor is a monaco editor, in which you can write code with proper language features, like Auto Complete, Hover and Siganature help.

  * a text editor is opened first, then closed and finally a webview is opened
* editors in the webview
  * load `monaco-editor` through webpack
